# Changelog

## Unreleased — Core 0.15.4

Aligns the Java SDK error catalogue with [Blnk Core 0.15.4](https://docs.blnkfinance.com/changelog/blnk-core)
and fills in list endpoints that Core exposes but the SDK did not wrap.

### Added

- `BlnkErrorCodes` now mirrors Core's full `error_detail.code` catalogue
  (`internal/apierror/codes.go`), grouped by prefix: `GEN_`, `AUTH_`, `APIKEY_`,
  `TXN_`, `BAL_`, `LGR_`, `ACC_`, `IDT_`, `RECON_`, `META_`, `HOOK_`, `QUEUE_`,
  `SRCH_`, and `ADMIN_`. Each constant documents the HTTP status Core pairs it with.
- Codes introduced or re-routed in Core 0.15.4 that callers should branch on:
  - `TXN_ALREADY_REFUNDED` (`409`): refunding a transaction twice, or refunding a
    refund. Previously the reversal went through.
  - `BAL_NOT_FOUND` (`404`): a transaction naming a missing balance. Previously
    reported as `TXN_NOT_FOUND`.
  - `TXN_VALIDATION_ERROR` (`400`) is now also returned for a split request that
    carries both `sources` and `destinations`.
  - `GEN_CONFLICT` (`409`) is now also returned when a multi-leg refund fails.
- `ledgers().list()` and `ledgerBalances().list()`, wrapping `GET /ledgers` and
  `GET /balances`. Both take an optional `ListOptions` with `limit` (at least
  `1`) and `offset` (at least `0`), sent as query parameters; unset fields fall
  back to Core's defaults of `10` and `0`. Invalid pagination is rejected
  client-side with a `400` before any request is made, matching Core's own
  `GEN_VALIDATION_ERROR` rules.
- `transactions().list()`, wrapping `GET /transactions`, with the same optional
  `ListOptions`. Core's default page here is `20`. Core silently falls back to
  its defaults on invalid pagination for this route; the SDK rejects it with a
  `400` instead so mistakes are visible.

### Unchanged

- The three existing constants (`TXN_INVALID_AMOUNT`, `GEN_CONFLICT`,
  `TXN_VALIDATION_ERROR`) keep their values; no caller changes are needed.

## 1.4.0 — Core 0.15.3

Aligns the Java SDK with [Blnk Core 0.15.3](https://docs.blnkfinance.com/changelog/blnk-core).

### Added

- Optional `dryRun(boolean)` (`dry_run`) on create, bulk create, refund, inflight
  update, bulk commit, and bulk void. Previews always return HTTP `200`; a
  projected rejection is `would_apply: false`, not an HTTP error.
- Typed dry-run response types: `DryRunTransactionResponse`,
  `DryRunRejection`, `DryRunBalanceProjection`, `DryRunLegProjection`, and
  `DryRunBulkTransactionResponse`.
- `notes()` on both dry-run wrappers, exposing Core's advisory messages such as
  a currency mismatch or legs being projected independently. A preview can carry
  notes while `would_apply` is still `true`, so read them before acting on a
  projection.
- `legs()` returns typed `DryRunLegProjection` entries (keyed by `identifier`,
  since a leg may name an internal `@` balance that does not exist yet).
- Optional `indicator(String)` on `CreateLedgerBalance` for creating internal
  balances with `ledgerId("general_ledger_id")`.
- Optional `description` and `metaData` on `RefundTransactionRequest`.
- `BlnkErrorCodes.TXN_INVALID_AMOUNT` and `BlnkErrorCodes.GEN_CONFLICT` for
  structured Core rejections.

### Confirmed

- `hooks().list()` with no type filter lists every hook (PRE and POST).
- Maven coordinates. `com.blnkfinance:blnk-java` is already the published
  coordinate as of `1.3.0` (Central, 2026-07-21), so this release continues it
  rather than introducing it. The older `com.blnkfinance:blnk-sdk:1.3.0` remains
  permanently resolvable for existing builds; migrate by changing only the
  `artifactId` to `blnk-java`, as the package names are unchanged.
